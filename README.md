# Grad_project
Our graduation project focuses on building a secure and well-managed network infrastructure integrated with SIEM (Security Information and Event Management)
The project is divided into three main phases:

Network Infrastructure Setup:
In this phase, we designed and built a complete network infrastructure that includes switches, routers, servers, and end-user devices. The goal was to create a scalable and reliable environment suitable for a real-world organization.

Network Administration:
Once the network was established, we implemented administrative controls such as user and group management, access policies, monitoring tools, and network services. This helped ensure proper operation, control, and maintenance of the network.

Security Implementation and Testing:
In the final phase, we focused on securing the network using a firewall and deploying a SIEM system. This included setting up security rules, monitoring for suspicious activity, and analyzing logs. After implementing the security measures, we conducted penetration testing and various security tests to evaluate the effectiveness of the protections in place.

Tools and Technologies Used:

VMware Workstation 16: Used to create and manage virtual machines for servers and clients.

EVE-NG (PNetLab v6): Utilized for simulating and configuring network devices like routers, switches, and firewalls.

Windows Server 2019: Deployed for managing network services such as Active Directory, DNS, and DHCP.

FortiGate Firewall: Implemented to provide advanced firewall protection and network security policies.

IBM QRadar SIEM (Community Edition): Used to collect, normalize, and analyze security logs and events for threat detection and incident response.
